Larry was starving. He was about to bite into his BLT when he heard an annoying, high-pitched, tiny voice.</p>

<p class="para2">"Whoa, watch it! You almost ate me…” the sandwich growled.</p>

<p class="para3">Larry blinked. "Did.. you just talk?"</p>

<p class="para4">"Yeah, it’s quite obviousa, Larry.And you're gonna eat me after all I've been through? Toasted, smeared, squished between bacon? Rude!!"</p>

<p class="para5">Larry stared, feeling quite baffled."Hah, of course I will. Bye bye sandwich! "</p>
